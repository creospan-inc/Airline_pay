# SkyComfort - Phase C Summary

## Overview
Phase C focused on implementing the backend server for the SkyComfort application, creating a robust REST API with TypeScript, Express, and SQLite, and ensuring seamless integration with the mobile application.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Server Infrastructure
- Set up a complete Node.js/Express server with TypeScript
- Implemented middleware for security, CORS, error handling, and authentication
- Created a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Set up environment-specific configuration management

### 2. Database Implementation
- Configured TypeORM for SQLite database interaction
- Created entity models for Users, Services, Orders, OrderItems, and Payments
- Implemented migrations for database schema management
- Added seeding capabilities for initial data population

### 3. Authentication System
- Implemented JWT-based authentication with token refresh capabilities
- Created secure user registration and login flows
- Added middleware for protecting routes based on user roles
- Implemented token validation and refresh mechanisms

### 4. API Endpoints
- Created comprehensive API for services, orders, payments, and authentication
- Implemented proper request validation
- Added standardized error handling
- Created documentation for all API endpoints

### 5. Synchronization Support
- Built API endpoints for handling batch synchronization
- Implemented conflict resolution strategies
- Added support for offline operation recording
- Created mechanisms for data merging

### 6. Mobile-Backend Integration
- Ensured API design is compatible with mobile app requirements
- Implemented efficient data transfer formats
- Created a consistent error reporting system
- Added support for both online and offline operations

## Technical Details

### API Structure
The server exposes the following main API endpoints:
- `/api/auth` - Authentication endpoints (login, register, refresh)
- `/api/services` - Service-related endpoints (list, details, filtering)
- `/api/orders` - Order management endpoints (create, list, details, update)
- `/api/payments` - Payment processing endpoints
- `/api/sync` - Data synchronization endpoints

### Database Schema
The SQLite database includes the following key entities:
- Users - User accounts and authentication information
- Services - Available in-flight services and products
- Orders - Customer orders for services
- OrderItems - Individual items within orders
- Payments - Payment transactions for orders

### Middleware
The server implements several middleware components:
- Authentication middleware for JWT validation
- Error handling middleware for consistent error responses
- Validation middleware for request data validation
- Logging middleware for request/response logging

## Next Steps
The next phase (Phase D) will focus on enhancing the integration between the mobile app and the backend server, implementing more advanced synchronization features, and adding comprehensive error handling.
